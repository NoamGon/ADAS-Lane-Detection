# ADAS-Lane-Detection
Lane detection algorithm for images acquired by the KITTI dataset.
The dataset is available for download through this link:
https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php?type=road

I used 2 datasets of car driving images from the Road category. The names of the sets are: 2011_09_26_drive_0028 and 2011_09_26_drive_0032.
I processed the images using image processing techniques and put them into a video. the code goes over only one dataset. 
In order for it to work you need to download the "synced+rectified data" versions of the datasets and then extract the zip files. Then run the "image_02" files in the code.
The code still doesn't work perfecly on both of the datasets. There is more work to do.
You can see how the code works in the following videos:
